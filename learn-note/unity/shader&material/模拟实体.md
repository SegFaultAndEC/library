## 漫反射率
In Unity, to represent diffuse reflectivity the URP/Lit Shader calls for a Base Map, which you have already used. Other shaders commonly call this property Albedo or Diffuse Map (even though, technically, these terms don’t mean exactly the same thing).
## 两种workflow
Specularity, as a property of a material, is one way to specify that a surface looks metallic. There are two workflows you can use to specify a metallic appearance in your materials. When you use the Specularity property in the URP/Lit shader, you are using the Specular workflow.
The Metallic workflow is simpler, but doesn’t strictly follow the rules of physical light.
### Which to chose?
When you import assets, you will see that some use the Specular workflow and others use Metallic. When you have a choice, you can use whichever you prefer. The Metallic workflow is more common because it is easier to work with, but it is not as scientific. The Specular workflow is based on real-world principles of reflectivity, but the coloured specular map makes it more challenging.
## Smoothness
Smoothness, also called gloss or glossiness, brings the specular reflection into focus. From a smooth surface, light reflects in a uniform way so that you can see the shape of the light source in the reflection.
