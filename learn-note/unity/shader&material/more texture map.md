## occlusion map
Occlusion, in 3D graphics, is the blockage of light by an object. A crack in a sidewalk and the thin dark shadow line between the fingers of a closed fist are examples of occlusion.
Occlusion maps are produced along with most models in 3D modeling software. The effects are sometimes subtle, but they make the light on surfaces more realistic and can enhance detailed shadows in ways that base maps and bump mapping cannot.
## microsurface map
If you wanted to model these items and include details like the fingerprints or scratches, you can use microsurface mapping to add a level of detail that isn't otherwise captured in your base map or normal map.
## emission map
You can use an emission map to specify areas where your surface will glow.
### HDR
HDR stands for high dynamic range. HDR colors have an additional luminosity outside the regular range of display colors. These are useful for glowing objects and intense specular reflections. The HDR color picker has an intensity slider to control how much additional luminosity is added to the color.
